## Choosing the Best Frozen Meatballs for Air Frying

Before you start cooking, selecting the right frozen meatballs is key to great results. Here’s what to consider when picking your meatballs:

### Types of Frozen Meatballs
- **Beef Meatballs**: Classic and hearty, ideal for Italian dishes like spaghetti and meatballs.
- **Turkey Meatballs**: Leaner and lighter, perfect for health-conscious eaters.
- **Chicken Meatballs**: Mild flavor, great for pairing with bold sauces.
- **Pork or Sausage Meatballs**: Rich and savory, excellent for appetizers or hearty meals.
- **Plant-Based Meatballs**: A fantastic option for vegetarians or those cutting back on meat.

### What to Look for When Buying Frozen Meatballs
- **Pre-Cooked vs. Raw**: Most frozen meatballs are pre-cooked, which is ideal for air frying as they only need to be heated through. Raw meatballs require longer cooking times and careful temperature checks.
- **Size**: Smaller meatballs (1-inch) cook faster and are great for appetizers, while larger ones (1.5-2 inches) work well for main dishes.
- **Ingredients**: Choose high-quality meatballs with minimal preservatives and fillers for better flavor and texture.
- **Seasoning**: Some meatballs come pre-seasoned or sauced, while others are plain, allowing you to customize flavors.

Popular brands like **Cooked Perfect**, **Johnsonville**, and **Beyond Meat** offer great options for air fryer frozen meatballs. Always check the package for air fryer cooking instructions, as they can vary slightly.

## How to Cook Frozen Meatballs in an Air Fryer

Cooking **frozen meatballs in air fryer** is straightforward, but a few tips can elevate your results. Below is a step-by-step guide to ensure perfectly cooked meatballs every time.

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Prepare the Air Fryer**: Most air fryers don’t require preheating, but if your model recommends it, set it to 400°F (200°C) for 3-5 minutes.
2. **Arrange the Meatballs**: Place frozen meatballs in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure even cooking. If needed, cook in batches.
3. **Set the Temperature and Time**:
   - For pre-cooked meatballs: Cook at 400°F (200°C) for 8-12 minutes.
   - For raw frozen meatballs: Cook at 375°F (190°C) for 12-15 minutes, ensuring the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) for poultry or 160°F (71°C) for beef/pork.
4. **Shake or Flip**: Halfway through cooking (around 5-6 minutes), shake the basket or flip the meatballs with tongs to ensure even browning.
5. **Check Doneness**: Use a meat thermometer to confirm the internal temperature. Pre-cooked meatballs should be hot throughout, while raw ones must meet safe temperature guidelines.
6. **Optional Sauce Toss**: If adding sauce (like marinara or BBQ), toss the meatballs in a bowl with your sauce after cooking for a flavorful finish.

### Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Frozen Meatballs
- **Don’t Thaw**: Cooking frozen meatballs directly from the freezer ensures the best texture and prevents drying out.
- **Light Oil Spray**: For extra crispiness, lightly spray the meatballs with olive oil or cooking spray before air frying.
- **Avoid Overcrowding**: Overlapping meatballs can lead to uneven cooking. Leave space for air circulation.
- **Batch Cooking**: If cooking a large batch, keep cooked meatballs warm in a low oven (200°F/93°C) while finishing the rest.

## Air Fryer Settings for Different Meatball Types

Different types of meatballs may require slight adjustments in cooking time and temperature. Here’s a quick guide:

| **Meatball Type**      | **Temperature** | **Cooking Time** | **Internal Temp** |

| Raw Beef/Pork           | 375°F (190°C)  | 12-15 minutes    | 160°F (71°C)      |
| Raw Poultry             | 375°F (190°C)  | 12-15 minutes    | 165°F (74°C)      |
